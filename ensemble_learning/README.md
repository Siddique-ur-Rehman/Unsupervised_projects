# Bagging and Boosting Projects

This repository contains code for two projects exploring ensemble learning techniques: Bagging and Boosting.

## Requirements

These projects share common dependencies. Please ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models (BaggingClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, etc.) and evaluating performance.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization (optional, but recommended).
