Customer Segmentation Analysis
Project Overview
This project leverages unsupervised machine learning (K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic data. The goal is to enable data-driven marketing strategies by identifying distinct customer groups.

Key Features
1. K-Means Clustering Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and normalizes data.

Clustering: Applies K-Means to group customers into meaningful segments.

Evaluation: Uses metrics like the Silhouette Score to assess cluster quality.

Visualization: Employs PCA for 2D/3D cluster visualization.

2. Hierarchical Clustering Approach
Dendrogram Analysis: Determines optimal clusters via hierarchical linkage.

Agglomerative Clustering: Builds a tree-based segmentation model.

Dimensionality Reduction: Uses PCA for interpretable visualizations.

Business Applications
Targeted Marketing: Tailor promotions based on customer segments.

Customer Retention: Identify high-value and at-risk groups.

Sales Optimization: Adjust strategies per segment behavior.

Technical Implementation
Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data: Structured customer data (e.g., purchase history, demographics)

How to Use
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.

Analyze and visualize customer segments.

Note: The project provides two clustering methodologies, allowing flexibility based on business needs. For further customization, adjust hyperparameters or integrate additional features.
